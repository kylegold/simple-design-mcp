# Simple Design MCP

Design beautiful apps without coding - just tell me what you want to build! 🎨

## What is Simple Design?

Simple Design is a conversational AI tool that helps non-technical builders create professional React and React Native apps through natural language. No coding required - just describe your vision and watch it come to life!

## Available Tools

### 🗣️ `simple_design_chat`
Start a conversation about your app idea. Just describe what you want in plain English!

**Example:**
```
Use simple_design_chat with message "I want to build a recipe sharing app for home cooks"
```

### 👀 `simple_design_show`
Preview your current design with all the details - colors, components, features, and layout.

**Example:**
```
Use simple_design_show to see my current design
```

### 📦 `simple_design_export`
Generate production-ready React or React Native code for your app.

**Example:**
```
Use simple_design_export to generate my app code
```

### 💡 `simple_design_examples`
Get inspiration from example app designs for different categories.

**Example:**
```
Use simple_design_examples with type "fitness" to see fitness app examples
```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Start Your Design Journey
Tell me about your app idea using natural language:
```
Use simple_design_chat with message "I need an app for tracking my plant watering schedule"
```

### Step 2: Answer Simple Questions
I'll ask you a few friendly questions to understand your vision better:
- Who will use your app?
- What's the main problem it solves?
- Any apps you like the style of?

No technical knowledge needed - just answer naturally!

### Step 3: Review Your Design
Check out what I've created for you:
```
Use simple_design_show
```

You'll see:
- Your chosen UI library (Material-UI, Tailwind, etc.)
- Color scheme perfectly matched to your app type
- All planned features and screens
- Mobile-first responsive layout

### Step 4: Make Changes
Want to adjust something? Just tell me:
```
Use simple_design_chat with message "Can we add a dark mode option?"
```

### Step 5: Export Your App
Happy with the design? Generate your code:
```
Use simple_design_export
```

You'll get a complete React/React Native project with:
- ✅ Clean, modular components
- ✅ Modern UI library integrated
- ✅ Responsive design built-in
- ✅ Ready to `npm install && npm start`

## Features

### 🎯 Smart Defaults
I automatically choose the perfect tech stack based on your app type:
- **Recipe Apps**: Warm colors, card layouts, Material-UI
- **Fitness Apps**: Energetic design, dashboards, Tailwind
- **Social Apps**: Modern feel, feeds, shadcn/ui
- **And many more...**

### 🔄 Iterative Design
Change your mind? No problem! Add features, adjust styles, or pivot your entire concept through natural conversation.

### 🚀 Production-Ready Code
Every app I generate includes:
- Professional project structure
- Package.json with all dependencies
- README with clear instructions
- Design documentation explaining all decisions
- Clean, maintainable code
