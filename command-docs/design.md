# /design-app Command

Start designing your app by describing what you want to build in plain language.

## How It Works

1. **Describe Your Idea**: Tell me about your app in your own words
2. **Answer Simple Questions**: I'll ask about your users and goals
3. **Get Smart Suggestions**: I'll recommend the perfect design based on your app type
4. **Iterate Naturally**: Continue the conversation to refine your design

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```
/design-app "I want to build a recipe sharing app"
```

### With Target Users
```
/design-app "I want to build a fitness tracker" --target_users "busy professionals"
```

### Specify Platform
```
/design-app "I need a task management app" --platform mobile
```

## What Happens Next

After you describe your app, I'll:
- Analyze your description to understand the app type
- Choose the perfect UI library (Material-UI, Tailwind, etc.)
- Select colors that match your app's purpose
- Suggest relevant features
- Create a mobile-first responsive design

You can then continue chatting to refine any aspect of the design!
